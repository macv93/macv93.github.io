Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a small, fun project I created using React and Vite. It's just a place for me to experiment and showcase some basic web development skills.

## About

This project was built with:

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Vite:** For a fast and efficient development experience.
- **GitHub Actions:** For automated deployment.

## Deployment

The site is deployed using GitHub Actions, which automates the build and deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

You can view the deployed site here: [https://macv93.github.io/](https://macv93.github.io/)
